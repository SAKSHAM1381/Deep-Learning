# Project
Digit Recognizer
Goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
